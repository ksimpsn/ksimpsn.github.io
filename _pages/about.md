Hi! I’m Kayla, a junior at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Engineering and Applied Science, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Cognitive Science and Linguistics. I’m passionate about education, etymology, history, user experience design, and uncovering surprising connections between fields!

In my free time, I dive into fantasy books (highly recommend The Stormlight Archive) and enjoy action/adventure video games like The Last of Us, Dying Light, and The Witcher. The more expansive and fantastical the world, the more immersed I feel!
