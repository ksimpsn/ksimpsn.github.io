Hi! I’m Kayla, a junior at the University of Pennsylvania’s School of Engineering and Applied Science, majoring in Computer Science with minors in Cognitive Science and Linguistics. I’m passionate about education, etymology, history, user experience design, and uncovering surprising connections between fields!

Outside of class, I am the Co-President of the Penn chapter of ColorStack, a national organization dedicated to increasing the number of Black, Latinx, and Indigenous students pursuing tech-related careers. We work to provide a strong community for all underrepresented groups in tech by offering resources, mentorship, and career development opportunities. I also volunteer as a developer for Hack4Impact, a student organization founded at Penn that partners with local Philadelphia nonprofits to create impactful software solutions. I've contributed to various nonprofits through this medium, such as AchieveNow and Box of Balloons. Additionally, I am a member of the Engineering Deans’ Advisory Board for Penn Engineering, where I act as a liaison between the student body and the deans. In this capacity, I provide insights and recommendations on issues affecting the school, ensuring the voices of students are properly communicated.

In my free time, I dive into fantasy books (highly recommend The Stormlight Archive) and enjoy action/adventure video games like The Last of Us, Dying Light, and The Witcher. The more expansive and fantastical the world, the more immersed I feel! I also enjoy collecting records, second-hand fashion, intramural volleyball, runnning with friends, and discovering new board games.
